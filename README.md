*** depricated ***
My appologies... this planetScale site has decided to no longer offer a free version, so soon this site will no longer function as designed. I have decided not to support updates in favor of working on other more important projects, but I will return to it in the future when freetime allows. 

# Next.js Chat App

Welcome to my Next.js chat application repository! This project showcases my skills in building real-time chat applications using modern technologies including Next.js, Vercel, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js. It's a demonstration of my ability to architect scalable and responsive web applications with a focus on user experience and performance.

## Overview

This chat application allows users to communicate in real-time, offering a seamless and interactive experience. Leveraging the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, Vercel for deployment, Prisma for database management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Node.js for backend logic, this project embodies the latest trends and best practices in web development.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Users can engage in real-time conversations, enabling instant messaging and collaboration.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a responsive design, ensuring a consistent and optimal experience across devices of all sizes.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The use of Next.js and Prisma ensures a scalable and maintainable architecture, capable of handling growing user bases and complex requirements.
- **Customization with Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS provides a flexible and utility-first approach to styling, allowing for easy customization and extensibility.
- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication and authorization are implemented securely, ensuring data privacy and protection.

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Netlify, offering a seamless deployment experience with automatic builds and continuous integration. HOWEVER, my free planetScale account has transitioned to paid, and I have decided not to support it financially at this time. You can access the demo by going to: https://silver-alpaca-ed5da0.netlify.app/ but there are no promises that it will function as designed.
